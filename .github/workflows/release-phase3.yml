# =============================================================================
# Release Phase 3 Caller Workflow
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose:
#   Calls the centralized reusable workflow from the meta repo.
#   Tags release, creates GitHub Release, syncs main → development.
#
# IMPORTANT: Uses `push` event instead of `pull_request: closed`
#   PRs created with GITHUB_TOKEN cannot trigger other workflows.
#   Push events bypass this limitation.
#
